##  SORTING AND SEARCHING ###############################################################################

--> worst way to sort elemennts in given array.
    ANS: first find all the permutation of the array and in which one permutation will be answer.
         complexity: O(N x N!)

--> what is good algorithm? ANS: 1. less space 2.good running time

1. Insertion Sort:
    divide the array which is given into 2 parts 1 is sortable and 2nd is non sortable . then pick one element 
    from non-sortable part and put it into  sortable part at right position until all the elemnts from non-sortable 
    part has not been covered.
